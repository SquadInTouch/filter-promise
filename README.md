# Filter-Promise

Library to bring human-oriented filtering for Promises.

## Which problem do we solve?

There is great [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/) which is awesome, fast and have `.filter` method which surprisingly filters
Iterable or Promise of Iterable which is quite cumbersome for those who familiar with promise/future conception
outside JavaScript.

This library brings tiny wrapper which allow to filter Promise's content with predicate function without throwing in `then` handlers.

## Examples

```javascript
// with then-filter

// without then-filter


```
